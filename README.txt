<strong>Genesis CRM</strong>, built on the <a href="http://www.billerickson.net/get-genesis">Genesis theme framework</a>.

<h3>Features:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Custom taxonomies and metaboxes for collecting your data.</li>
<li>Prospects page template that is 3 widgetized columns. I’ve built a lot of widgets to analyze prospects, so choose the ones you want. Examples: Activity Graph, Source of Inquiry, Source of Projects, Outstanding Quotes… and more.</li>
<li>Active Projects page template. This lists all active projects in order of project status. It includes a status summary and budget. There’s also a “Needs Work” radio button when editing a project, and if marked the project will have a yellow background. This let’s you quickly see which projects need work. In the sidebar I list scheduled projects so you can be ready for those when they come up.</li>
<li>Completed Projects page template. This lists completed projects, the budget, time spent, and effective hourly rate. Use this to see what types of projects you over- or under-quote on to improve your estimates. Note: there is no timer built-in. I use <a href="http://www.toggl.com">Toggl</a> and every Sunday I transcribe that week’s time data to the fields on each project.</li>
<li>Any time you click the name of a project it takes you directly to the Edit Post screen. Since I’m constantly editing projects’ status, this saves the extra step of clicking “Edit” and gives you a single interface for viewing this information rather than a single post screen and the edit screen.</li>
<li>If you’re using Gravity Forms, edit the Form page template with the appropriate form ID and you’ll be able to embed a contact form on your public site that automatically populates your CRM (<a href="http://www.billerickson.net/contact-form-to-wordpress-crm/">tutorial here</a>).</li>
<li>The design is responsive, so on a smaller screen (ex: mobile phone) it shifts to a single column layout.</li>
</ul>
